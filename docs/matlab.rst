MHKiT-Matlab
========================================

MHKiT-Matlab is an open source Matlab package intended for the processing of MRE and MRE realted datasets. 

The MHKiT-Matlab repository is located at https://github.com/MHKiT-Code-Hub/mhkit-matlab.

The package contains the following modules:

* :ref:`qc`: Perform quality control analysis
* :ref:`wave`: Calculate quantities of interest for wave energy converters (WEC)
* :ref:`river`: Calculate quantities of interest for river energy converters (REC)
* :ref:`tidal`: Calculate quantities of interest for tidal energy converters (TEC)

MHKiT-Matlab uses structures to store data. A structure array is a data type that groups related data using data containers called fields.
For more information about Matlab structures, see  https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/structures.html.
